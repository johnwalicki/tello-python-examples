Fly your Tello Drone using the TelloPy python library

# How to Use Python Library

1. Install the TelloPy library `pip install tellopy`

  If you don't have pip installed on your machine, you can simply clone the repo
  (ie, download a *.zip* file of the repo which is located at: <a href="https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy">https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy</a>)
  In my case, I have a folder called "./drone" - downloading the zip file there and unpacking results in a new folder called ./drone/TelloPy-develop-0.7.0 - all of your working code should reside there

  In your python programs, simply `import tellopy` and you're ready to go !

See more usage examples [here](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy).
